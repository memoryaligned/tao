# Few Shot

```python
fewshot_prompt = """Predict whether the following document is a positive or negative movie review:

[DOCUMENT]

Examples of negative movie reviews are:
- a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time, and this isn't.
- the film, like Jimmy's routines, could use a few laughs.

Examples of a positive movie reviews are:
- very predictable but still entertaining
- a solid examination of the male midlight crisis

If it is positive say 1 and if it is negative say 0.  Do no give any other answers.
```
